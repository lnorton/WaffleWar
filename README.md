# WaffleWar
A silly demo app to play with map stuff.

In the python directory are scripts that can scrape the locations of every Waffle House, Huddle House, and IHOP from their respective websites.

From those files, voronoi.py can partition the United States into terrorities, one for each restaurant.

Each terroritory is rendered by the Android and iOS application in their respective directories. You'll need an API key for Google Maps on Android.
